# RL glue for the HF transformers modeling backend: a ModelSpec factory whose
# result satisfies the async-RL contract (HF weight loading via the near-identity
# state-dict adapter, titan-shaped ``layers`` view) so the RL trainer, the vLLM
# generator wrapper, and torchft consume it like a native model spec. Mirrors
# the pretraining glue pattern: compose at the ModelSpec seam, no RL-consumer
# edits.
#
# TODO(async-rl, unverified): this subpackage was re-based from the old
# transformers-backend design onto the current one. Two behavioral changes are
# NOT yet runtime-validated (no GPU/checkpoint available at port time):
#   1. Attention is now the backend's flex path (document/block-causal
#      BlockMask via ``get_attention_masks``), NOT the old varlen kernel. The RL
#      trainer drives it through ``get_attention_masks`` + ``positions`` exactly
#      as the native decoder path does.
#   2. The architecture dims are injected explicitly from the checkpoint's
#      ``config.json`` (via AutoConfig) into ``TitanModelConfig`` so the config
#      is architecture-complete at registry time (the generator wrapper and the
#      ``layers`` shim read head/kv/dim off it before any trainer build). Final
#      HF-config resolution + weight loading happen when the trainer builds the
#      model. The old registry-time ``update_from_config`` call is dropped: the
#      current backend's ``update_from_config`` requires a full runtime config
#      (training/parallelism/debug), which isn't available at registry time.
